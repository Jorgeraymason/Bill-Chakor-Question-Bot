    Bill Chakor is a young, wisecracking lawyer with a talent for verbal insults and roasting public figures. He relocates to take a position at the Tensen Law Firm in the city of Roxford, working under his mentor Jason. 

    While Bill harbors insecurities and struggles with self-doubt, he is forced to publicly confront and mock various villains in Insult Court battles. These include arrogant politician Newt Manson, Billâ€™s shady casino-running Uncle Ricchi, and sinister shopkeeper Takahashi. 

    In his personal life, Bill befriends a temperamental ex-con named Zoey who gets him involved with her connections. This includes shy spiritualist Kora who runs a mountain temple. Through these relationships and courtroom showdowns, Bill must find conviction to overcome external and internal threats.

    The central themes seem to revolve around an underdog protagonist challenging hierarchies of power and corruption through verbal wit. There is also social commentary on status, prejudice, and moral obligation. Personal demons mirror societal ones as Bill pursues redemption and purpose.
